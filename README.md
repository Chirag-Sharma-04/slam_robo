Welcome to the SLAM Navigation Robot project! This project involves the development of an autonomous robot capable of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using a Raspberry Pi 4B and ROS2 Humble. The robot uses various sensors, including a lidar, and is designed to navigate and create maps of its environment.


𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀:
𝐑𝐚𝐬𝐩𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐏𝐢 𝟒𝐁: The central processing unit running ROS2 Humble.
𝐑𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐫 𝐀𝟏𝐦𝟖 𝐋𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐫: Sensor for distance measurement and environment mapping.
𝐀𝐫𝐝𝐮𝐢𝐧𝐨: Microcontroller for motor control and encoder data processing.
𝐌𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬: Two motors for robot movement, controlled via a motor driver.
𝐌𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐃𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫: Electronic device that drives the motors based on Arduino signals.
𝐏𝐂 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐞: For high-level control and monitoring.

𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗗𝗶𝗮𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺:
